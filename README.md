## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that the user would need to refer to the data.js file in order to know all the criterias that can be input in this webpage. In order to fix this, an alternative would be to incorporate the data file into the webpage on a form of a list dropdown menu or a link to the data file so the user can aquickly visualize the criterias that can be used
